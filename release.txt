Changelog:

Option nostaggered has been deprecated. There are new options to handle imputation of the policy variable in scenarios where it may be missing for some units or time periods. In xtevent 1.0.0 the default was to impute the policy variable at missing values and at the beginning and end of each timeseries in a manner consistent with staggered adoption. This default behavior has changed to not imputing the policy variable. To obtain similar results to those using xtevent 1.0.0 please use the option impute(stag).

Options for trend extrapolation when the variable is not binary
