{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd: xtevent} estimates the effect of a policy variable of interest on a dependent variable using a panel event-study 
design. Additional control variables can be included in {it:varlist}. The command allows for estimation when a pre-trend
 is present using the instrumental variables estimator of Freyaldenhoven et al. (2019). It also allows estimation in 
 settings with heterogeneous effects by cohort using the Interaction Weighted Estimator of Sun and Abraham (2021).{p_end}


{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}
 
{dlgtab:Main}

{phang}
{opth policyvar(varname)} specifies the policy variable of interest. {opt policyvar()} is required.

{dlgtab:Estimation}

{phang}
{opth panelvar(varname)} specifies the cross-sectional identifier variable that identifies the panels. {cmd:panelvar()} is required if the data
have not been previously {cmd:xtset}. See {help xtset}.

{phang}
{opth timevar(varname)} specifies the time variable. {cmd:timevar()} is required if the data have not been previously {cmd:xtset}. See
{help xtset}.

{phang}
{opth window(numlist)} specifies the window around the policy change event to estimate dynamic effects. If a single positive integer {it:k}>0 
is specified, the estimation will use a symmetric window of {it:k} periods around the event. For example, if {it:k} = 2, there will be five 
coefficients in the window (-2,-1,0,1,2) and two endpoints (-3+, 3+). If two distinct integers {it:k1}<=0 and {it:k2}>=0 are specified, the 
estimation will use an asymmetric window with {it:k1} periods before the event and {it:k2} periods after the event. For example, with {it:k1} = -1 
and {it:k2} = 2, there will be four coefficients in the window (-1,0,1,2) and two endpoints (-2+,3+). {opt window()} is required unless 
{opt static} is specified, or if the estimation window is specified using  options {opt pre()}, {opt post()}, {opt overidpre()}, 
and {opt overidpost()} (See below).

{phang}
{opt pre},
{opt post}, 
{opt overidpre} and 
{opt overidpost} offer an alternative way to specify the estimation window:

{phang2} {opt pre} is the number of pre-event periods where anticipation effects are allowed. With {opt window}, {opt pre} is 0.

{phang2} {opt post} is the number of post-event periods where policy effects are allowed. With {opt window}, {opt post} is the number
of periods after the event (not including the period for the event, e.g. event time = 0), 
except the lastest two periods (assigned to {opt overidpost} for the leveling off test).

{phang2} {opt overidpre} is the number of pre-event periods for an overidentification test of pre-trends. With {opt window}, {opt overidpre}
is the number of periods before the event.

{phang2} {opt overidpost} is the number of post-event periods for an overidentification test of effects leveling off. With {opt window},
{opt overidpost} is 2.

{phang} Only one of {opt window}  or 
{opt pre},
{opt post}, 
{opt overidpre} and 
{opt overidpost} can be declared. 

{phang} {opth norm(integer)} specifies the event-time coefficient to be normalized to 0.
The default is to normalize the coefficient on -1.

{phang}
{opth proxy(varlist)} specifies proxy variables for the confound to be included.

{phang}
{opth proxyiv(string)} specifies instruments for the proxy variable for the policy. {cmd:proxyiv()} admits three syntaxes to use 
either leads of the policy variable or additional variables as instruments. The default is to use leads of the difference of the
policy variable as instruments, selecting the lead with the strongest first stage. 

{phang2}
{cmd:proxyiv(select)} selects the lead with the strongest first stage among all possible leads of the differenced policy variable to 
be used as an instrument.
{cmd:proxyiv(select)} is the default for the one proxy, one instrument case, and it is only available in this case. 

{phang2}
{cmd:proxyiv(# ...)} specifies a numlist with the leads of the differenced policy variable as instruments. For example, 
{cmd:proxyiv(1 2)} specifies that the two first leads of the difference of the policy variable will be used as instruments.

{phang2}
{cmd:proxyiv(varlist)} specifies a {it:varlist} with the additional variables to be used as instruments.

{phang}
{opt nofe} excludes panel fixed effects.

{phang}
{opt note} excludes time fixed effects.

{phang}
{opt impute(type, [ saveimp])} imputes missing values in {it:policyvar} and uses this new variable as the actual {it:policyvar}. 
{cmd:type} determines the imputation rule. The suboption {cmd:saveimp} adds the new variable to the database as 
{it:policyvar_imputed}. The following imputation types are available:

{phang2}
{cmd:impute(nuchange)} imputes missing values in {it:policyvar} according to {it:no unobserved change}: it assumes that 
for each unit: i) in periods before the first observed value, the policy value is the same as the first observed value and;
 ii) in periods after the last observed value, the policy value is the same as the last observed value.

{phang2}
{cmd:impute(stag)} applies {it:no unobserved change} if {it:policyvar} satisfies staggered-adoption assumptions for all units: 
i) {it:policyvar} must be binary, and ii) once {it:policyvar} reaches the adopted-policy state, it never reverts to the 
unadopted-policy state. See Freyaldenhoven et al. (2021) for detailed explanation of the staggered adoption case.

{phang2}
{cmd:impute(instag)} applies {opt impute(stag)} and additionally imputes missing values inside the observed data range: a missing 
value or a group of them will be imputed only if they are both preceded and followed by the unadopted-policy state or by the 
adopted-policy state. 

{phang}
{opt static} estimates a static panel data model and does not generate or plot event-time dummies. {opt static} is not allowed with 
{opt window}, {opt pre}, {opt post}, {opt overidpre}, {opt overidpost}, or {opt diffavg}.

{phang}
{opt diffavg} calculates the difference in averages between the post-event estimated coefficients and the pre-event estimated 
coefficients periods. It also calculates its standard error with {help lincom}. {opt diffavg} is not allowed with {opt static}.

{phang}
{opt tr:end(#1 [, subopt])} extrapolates a linear trend using the time periods from period #1 before the policy change to one
period before the policy change, as in Dobkin et al. (2018). For example, {cmd: trend(-3)} uses the coefficients on event-times
-3, -2, and -1 to estimate the trend. The estimated effect of the policy is the deviation from the extrapolated linear trend. 
#1 must be less than -1. {opt trend} is only available when the normalized coefficient is -1 and {opt pre} = 0.
The following can be passed as suboptions:

{phang2}
{opt method(string)} sets the method to estimate the linear trend. It can be Ordinary Least Squares {opt (ols)} or Generalized Method of 
Moments {opt (gmm)}. {opt (ols)} omits the event-time dummies from {opt trend(#1)} to -1 and adds a linear trend (_ttrend) to the regression. 
{opt (gmm)} uses the GMM to compute the trend for the event-time dummy coefficients. The default is {opt method(gmm)}.

{phang2}
{opt saveov:erlay} saves estimations for the overlay plot produced by {opt xteventplot, overlay(trend)}.

{phang}
{opt savek(stub [, subopt])} saves variables for time-to-event, event-time, trend, and interaction variables. Event-time dummies are stored as 
{it: stub}_eq_m# for the dummy variable # periods before the policy change, and {it:stub}_eq_p# for the dummy variable # periods after the 
policy change. The dummy variable for the policy change time is {it:stub}_eq_p0. Event time is stored as {it:stub}_evtime. The trend is stored
 as {it:stub}_trend. For estimation with the Sun and Abrahm (2021) method, such that {opt cohort} and {opt control_cohort} are active, the
 interaction variables are stored as {it:stub}_m#_c# or {it:stub}_p#_c#, where c# indicates the cohort. The following suboptions can be
 specified:

{phang2}
{opt noe:stimate} saves variables for event-time dummies, event-time, and trends without estimating the model. This option is helpful if the 
users want to customize their regressions and plots.

{phang2}
{opt saveint:eract} saves interaction variables if {opt cohort} and {opt control_cohort} are specified. {opt noe:stimate} and 
{opt saveint:eract} cannot be specified simultaneously.

{phang}
{opt usek(stub)} uses previously used event-time dummies saved with prefix {it:stub}. This can be used to speed up estimation.

{phang}
{opt reghdfe} uses {help reghdfe} for estimation, instead of {help areg}, {help ivregress}, and {help xtivreg}. {opt reghdfe} is useful for large 
datasets. By default, it absorbs the panel fixed effects and the time fixed effects. For OLS estimation, the {opt reghdfe}
option requires {help reghdfe} and {help ftools} to be installed. For IV estimation, it also requires {help ivreghdfe} and {help ivreg2}
 to be installed. Note that standard errors may be different and singleton clusters may be dropped using {help reghdfe}.
 See Correia (2016).

{phang}
{opt addabsorb(varlist)} specifies additional fixed effects to be absorbed when using {help reghdfe}. By default, {cmd:xtevent} includes time
 and unit fixed effects. {opt addabsorb} requires {opt reghdfe}.

{phang}
{opt repeatedcs} indicates that the dataset in memory is repeated cross-sectional. In this case, {opt panelvar} should indicate the groups 
at which {opt policyvar} changes. For instance, {opt panelvar} could indicate states at which {opt policyvar} changes, while the observations 
in the dataset are individuals in each state. An alternative method to
estimate the event study in a repeated cross-sectional dataset involves using {cmd:get_unit_time_effects} first, and then {cmd:xtevent}. See the description of the {help get_unit_time_effects} command below. For fixed-effects 
estimation, {opt repeatedcs} enables {opt reghdfe}.

{phang}
{opt cohort(varname)} specifies the variable that identifies the cohort for each unit. {opt cohort} and {opt control_cohort} indicate {cmd:xtevent}
 to estimate the event-time coefficients with the estimator of Sun and Abraham (2021) for settings with heterogeneous effects by cohort. {opt cohort} requires the
 Stata module {cmd:avar}; click {stata ssc install avar :here} to install or type "ssc install avar" from inside Stata.

{phang}
{opt control_cohort(varname)} specifies the binary variable that identifies the control cohort. {opt cohort} and {opt control_cohort} indicate
 {cmd:xtevent} to estimate the event-time coefficients with the estimator of Sun and Abraham (2021) for settings with heterogeneous effects by cohort. 
 {opt control_cohort} requires the Stata module {cmd:avar}; click {stata ssc install avar :here} to install or type "ssc install avar" from 
 inside Stata.

{phang}
{opt plot} displays a default event-study plot with 95% and sup-t confidence intervals (Montiel Olea and Plagborg-Møller 2019).
Additional options are available with the postestimation command {help xteventplot}.

{phang}
{it: additional_options}: Additional options to be passed to the estimation command. When {opt proxy} is specified, these options are passed
to {help ivregress}. When {opt reghdfe} is specified, these options are passed to {help reghdfe}. Otherwise, they are passed to {help areg} or
to {help regress} if {opt nofe} is specified. This option is useful for calculating clustered standard errors or changing regression reporting. Note
that two-way clustering is allowed with {help reghdfe}.
